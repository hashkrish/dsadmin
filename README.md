# DSAdmin: Google Cloud Datastore Emulator Admin UI

[![Build](https://github.com/remko/dsadmin/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/remko/dsadmin/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still in alpha testing phase. Feedback and bugreports welcome!**

Administration GUI for the Google Cloud Datastore Emulator.

- Supports browsing, editing, creating, deleting, querying (using GQL), import, export, ...
- Supports large databases
- Does not have problematic dependencies (such as gRPC, which are not available
  on all platforms)
- Portable: Implemented entirely in the frontend as an SPA. 
  Uses the [Datastore REST API](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/reference/data/rest) directly from
  the frontend. The only thing a server is used for is for proxying to the datastore emulator 
  (to avoid CORS problems), and to serve the HTML and JS files. 
  The NPM package uses a small Node.js server. A small [self-contained binary server](https://github.com/remko/dsadmin/releases)
  is also provided, avoiding the need for any system dependencies.
  If for some reason you need this to be available in a specific environment (Java, Python, ...), it should 
  be easy to create a similar server to run this in.
  

## Why?

Since Google stopped shipping an admin interface for their Datastore Emulator,
there have been some external projects trying to fill the gap. However, all of
the ones I tried were either partially or completely broken, lacked in core
features, had performance issues, were painful to set up, or had dependencies
that prevented them from e.g. being installed in a non-x86 Docker image.

This project tries to fix all of the issues with the other Datastore admin
interfaces, and even improve on the original Google interface in some areas.

## üìñ Usage

### Using NPM

Using the environment from the emulator:

    eval $(gcloud beta emulators datastore env-init --data-dir=DATA-DIR)
    npx dsadmin

Using command-line arguments:

    npx dsadmin --project=my-datastore-project --datastore-emulator-host=localhost:8081

### Using a pre-built binary

Download the correct binary for your OS 
from the [Releases page](https://github.com/remko/dsadmin/releases).

Start using the environment from the emulator:

    eval $(gcloud beta emulators datastore env-init --data-dir=DATA-DIR)
    ./dsadmin
    
Start using command-line arguments:

    ./dsadmin --project=my-datastore-project --datastore-emulator-host=localhost:8081

### Using Docker

    docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/remko/dsadmin:latest \
      --project=my-project --datastore-emulator-host=host.docker.internal:8081

### Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` that starts the Datastore Emulator and the Datastore Admin
container:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  # DSAdmin container
  dsadmin:
    image: "ghcr.io/remko/dsadmin:latest"
    depends_on:
      - datastore
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID: my-datastore-project
      DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST: "datastore:8081"

  # Datastore Emulator container
  datastore:
    image: "gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk:latest"
    volumes:
      - datastore_data:/opt/datastore/data
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    command: [
      "gcloud", "--quiet", "beta", "emulators" ,"datastore", "start", 
      "--host-port=0.0.0.0:8081", "--data-dir=/opt/datastore/data"
    ]
    environment:
      CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT: my-datastore-project

volumes:
  datastore_data:
```

## üíª Development

Start a Datastore emulator:

    npm run start-emulator
    
Start the development server:

    npm start

If you want to run against your own running instance of the Datastore emulator:

    eval $(gcloud beta emulators datastore env-init --data-dir=DATA-DIR)
    npm start

Using command-line:

    env DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID=my-datastore-project \
      DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:7081 \
      npm start
